- [Pinned OKF v0.2 specification](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/374e0bc4c644310ff56cdf9c0fe81eccdec862b0/okf/SPEC.md)

## Conventions
- Each concept has a stable path.
- Concept files use YAML frontmatter with a non-empty `type`.
- Relationships are ordinary Markdown links.
- Claims that depend on an external implementation should carry source/provenance context.
- Project-specific behavior must not be presented as ecosystem-wide consensus.
- Corrections should update the concept and preserve meaningful history in version control.

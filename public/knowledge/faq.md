# Frequently asked questions about scrobbling

## Why is anime a separate catalogue facet?

Anime is a separate filter because it helps people find projects that track episodes, specials, split releases, continuing titles and rewatches. It is a navigation choice, not a claim that anime sits outside film or television. A project can appear under more than one media type.

## How do common tracking projects differ?

Projects differ in media scope, capture method, hosting model and the records they keep. Some receive playback events, some provide a diary, some keep listening history, and some store a self-hosted record across several media. The [HTML FAQ](https://scrobble.dev/faq/#trackers) compares Fasti, Last.fm, ListenBrainz, Trakt, Simkl, Letterboxd and WeTrakr.

## What should a portable scrobble preserve?

A portable record should preserve stable event identity, the media type, the source-local identity known at the time, event and recorded timestamps, native progress, provenance, correction or deletion state, and enough retry information to prevent duplicate history.

## Can the Scrobble.dev catalogue be reused commercially?

Yes. Scrobble.dev releases the catalogue under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). That dedication covers the catalogue published by Scrobble.dev. Linked projects, repositories and upstream data retain their own terms. A software licence does not automatically grant rights to data used by that software.

## How can I contribute?

Use the [Scrobble.dev issue tracker](https://github.com/Scrobble-dev/scrobble.dev/issues/new) for a factual correction or project update. Include the claim, a primary source and the date checked. Use the [Fasti issue tracker](https://github.com/Scrobble-dev/Fasti/issues) for application changes.

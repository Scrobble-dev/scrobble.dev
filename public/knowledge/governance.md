# Scrobble.dev governance

Scrobble.dev is maintained in public through its repository, issues and pull requests. Published material distinguishes stable editorial definitions from versioned draft profiles.

## Factual corrections

A focused issue or pull request may correct a project fact, source, date, example or wording error. The change should include the primary source and date checked.

## Vocabulary changes

A material change to a core definition should state:

- the term and current definition
- the reason for change
- established examples or behaviour
- effects on related pages and machine-readable files
- compatibility concerns

## Draft-profile changes

A draft-profile change should include a concrete case or fixture and identify its effect:

1. Clarification: semantics do not change.
2. Extension: an optional capability is added.
3. Addition: a new versioned surface is introduced.
4. Breaking change: existing semantics become incompatible and require a new version.

Draft profiles are published for testing and comment. They are not adopted industry standards.

## Project updates

Project entries should record current sources, verification dates and unknown facts explicitly. Inclusion does not endorse or rank a project. A stale claim remains queued for review until evidence confirms, changes or removes it.

## Open questions

Unresolved questions may be published with their evidence and consequences. Editorial completeness does not justify invented consensus.
